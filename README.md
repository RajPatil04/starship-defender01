## 🚀 How I Built It Using Amazon Q CLI

I used **Amazon Q Developer CLI** to rapidly prototype and build the core game logic:

1. Generated game boilerplate using natural language prompts.
2. Iteratively improved features like:
   - Enemy spawning
   - Collision handling
   - Audio and visual feedback
3. Used Q CLI's `q dev` and `q generate` commands for faster implementation.
